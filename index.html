                <p>My name is Daniel Bushman and I am a 34 year old budding web developer. I decided to make a transition from something comepletely 
                non-tech related, to web development because I haven't had anything
                very exciting in past work environments. I decided I wanted something
                more.
                    I wanted something both challenging, and something with a space for
                my hitherto undernourished creativity. Of course, there is no-one 
                to nourish the forementioned creativity other than myself. What better way to do that than to dive head-first into coding?
